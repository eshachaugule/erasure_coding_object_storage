Step 1: INTEL ISA-L Library

To use the erasure coding functionality, the Intelligent Storage Acceleration Library (ISA-L) developed by Intel is used extensively. 
ISA-L is an open-source library that is a collection of optimized low-level functions targeting storage applications. It provides a 
set of optimized functions for accelerating data storage and processing operations, such as data compression, erasure coding, and 
cryptography. The library is designed to take advantage of the latest Intel processors' hardware features to provide high-performance 
data processing. This approach will use several of its functionalities and features in its implementation. 

Download and install the library from:              

https://01.org/sites/default/files/downloads/intelr-storage-acceleration-library-open-source-version/isa-lopensrc2.13.tar.gz

Unzip and Untar it using “gunzip” and “tar -xvf” respectively.
In library, please go through documentation and installation doc.


Step 2: BUILD the Project

Run the following commands to build the code:

-> sudo apt install make
-> make clean
-> sudo apt install gcc
-> gcc ObjectStorageErasureCoding.c -o ObjectStorageErasureCoding
-> make all
