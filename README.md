# erasure_coding_object_storage
An approach to storage system architecture that addresses the risk of hardware failures and data loss, by storing data efficiently, as well as recovering data if it is lost. It discusses the implementation of object storage using Erasure Coding (EC), which offers an efficient and cost-effective solution for protecting mission-critical data.
