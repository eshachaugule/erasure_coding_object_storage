# Erasure Coding Object Storage
Storage systems exist in a variety of shapes and sizes, but they all have one thing in common: the risk of failure and data loss. IT administrators responsible for storage system architecture must plan ahead to ensure mission-critical data is not lost in the event of a failure. This solution presents an approach to storage system architecture that addresses the risk of hardware failures and data loss, by storing data efficiently, as well as recovering data if it is lost. It discusses the implementation of object storage using Erasure Coding (EC), which offers an efficient and cost-effective solution for protecting mission-critical data. The novelty of this approach lies in the use of Reed-Solomon erasure coding, which encodes each object into redundant fragments that can be distributed across multiple storage nodes. In the event of a node failure, these fragments can be reconstructed to recover the data without the need for costly replication-based methods. This approach can provide a higher level of fault tolerance compared to traditional replication-based approaches, while minimizing storage costs and increasing scalability.
